## Tutorials

* [sclbl-101-getting-started](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/tree/master/sclbl-101-getting-started): A step-by-step explanation of the use of Scailable. This tutorial shows how to sign up for a *beta* account, and how to create a first Scailable endpoint using the `sclblpy` package. 
* [sclbl-create-your-own-wasm](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/tree/master/sclbl-create-your-own-wasm): This tutorial shows how to create your own custom WebAssembly executable using `c` (and the [wasienv](https://medium.com/wasmer/wasienv-wasi-development-workflow-for-humans-1811d9a50345) toolchain) that can be deployed on the Scailable platform.
* [sclbl-using-the-webnode](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/tree/master/sclbl-using-the-webnode): A tutorial that demonstrates how to run a Scailable WebAssembly task either in the browser or in our Scailable cloud - automatic fallback included!

## Interactive demos
Next to the tutorials presented in this repository, we also have a number of interactive demos:

* [Scailable supports running complex models](https://www.scailable.net/demo/avm/) (such at [Bayesian Additive Regression Trees](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1273584455)) in the cloud, on the edge, or on a browser. Check how we can flexibly generate posterior predictive inferences for automatic property valuation models, anytime, anywhere.
* [Sometimes what you need is performance](https://www.scailable.net/demo/bench/). We provide nothing less. The inferences from our models are extremely fast; check out some of our benchmarks.

## Videos:
Some sample video's of the use of Scailable:

* [Introducing the Scailable platform](https://youtu.be/47wUrjtgFcs). A simple video showcasing the basic functionalities of the Scailable platform.

## Posts:
Some posts / articles:

* [Stop training more models, start deploying them](https://towardsdatascience.com/stop-training-more-models-start-deploying-them-using-webassembly-49a3f178569e). An article detailing the challenges when deploying models in healthcare.
* [From model fitting to production in seconds](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-model-fitting-to-production-in-seconds-8e6823d87f5d). The shortage usage example of Scailable we were able to write.

## Data Values and Principles:

Scailable is committed to the advancement of AI driven by ethical principles that put people first. To further clarify this position, we make our "Ethical Data Science Manifesto" (building on from the Linux Foundation' s "[Data Values and Principles](https://datapractices.org/manifesto/)") available [here](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/blob/master/RESPONSIBLE-AI-MANIFESTO.md). As we acknowledge that this area is dynamic and evolving, we expect to adapt, update and further develop the manifesto as we as we learn over time. 

We also invite our users to check their project(s) against *[deon](https://deon.drivendata.org/)*, an open source command line tool that allows you to easily add an ethics checklist to your data science projects.
